# Dumb-list (Ranking Osmar Terraplana)

This project is a joke on the face of populist politicians and other people who denial covid-19.

The project is a list of the worst predictions made to COVID-19, such as "It is a small flu" or "(In Brazil) Less than 800 people will die from it".

You can find the (Brazilian) live version here: https://dumb-list.azurewebsites.net/
